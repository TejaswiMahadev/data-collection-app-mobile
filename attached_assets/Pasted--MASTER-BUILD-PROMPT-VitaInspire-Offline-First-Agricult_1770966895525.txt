🔥 MASTER BUILD PROMPT
VitaInspire – Offline-First Agricultural Mobile App (Structured Workflow)

I want to build a production-ready Android mobile application using Flutter.

App Name: VitaInspire – Smart Crop Data App

This is an offline-first, multilingual, step-based agricultural field data collection app with structured photo capture workflow.

This is NOT a simple form app.

🎯 APP PURPOSE

The app will be used by field officers in rural India (Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh) to collect maize harvest and agronomic data using a structured, guided workflow.

The app must:

Work 100% offline

Auto-save continuously

Guide field movement physically

Enforce structured photo sequence

Be farmer-friendly and multilingual

Sync data intelligently when internet is available

🟢 TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Framework: Flutter
Local Database: Hive or SQLite
Camera: image_picker or camera package
Background Sync: WorkManager
Localization: Flutter Intl
Audio: audioplayers
Backend API (placeholder): https://api.vitainspire.com
